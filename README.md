# Project Overview

This repository outlines the implementation of an MVC application with the following key features:

1. **Login Page**:
   - A dedicated page for users to log in to their accounts securely.

2. **Sign-Up Page**:
   - Users can navigate from the login page to the sign-up page to create a new account.

3. **Navigation Between Login and Sign-Up**:
   - Users can easily switch between the login and sign-up pages.

4. **Forgot Password Functionality**:
   - A "Forgot Password" link on the login page allows users to enter their email address and receive a reset password link via email.

5. **Google Login Integration**:
   - Users can log in using their Google accounts through a Google login button on the login page.

6. **Token-Based Authentication**:
   - The application utilizes token-based authentication to secure user sessions.

7. **Post-Login Dashboard**:
   - After logging in, users can access four distinct pages, each displaying a table of corresponding database entries. These pages allow users to view, edit, create, or delete records:
   - **User Page**: Displays a table of users with options for editing and deleting.
   - **Employee Page**: Shows a list of employees with management options.
   - **Department Page**: Lists departments and allows for modifications.
   - **Role Page**: Displays roles within the application with options for editing and deletion.

By implementing these features, this MVC project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing user accounts and related data efficiently.
