8. **Token-Based Authentication**:
   - The application utilizes token-based authentication to secure user sessions.

9. **Post-Login Dashboard**:
   - After logging in, users can access four distinct pages, each displaying a table of corresponding database entries. These pages allow users to view, edit, create, or delete records:
   - **User Page**: Displays a table of users with options for editing and deleting.   
   - **Employee Page**: Shows a list of employees with management options.
   - **Department Page**: Lists departments and allows for modifications.
   - **Role Page**: Displays roles within the application with options for editing and deletion.

By implementing these features, this MVC project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing user accounts and related data efficiently.
